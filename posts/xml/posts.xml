        Last night I stood on the rooftop overlooking the city, and it felt surreal. The clouds were heavy, hanging low like they were about to burst, turning the sky into this deep electric blue. The air smelled like rain but it never came. Below me, the city buzzed — headlights crawling like fireflies, windows glowing warm in the cold dusk, and distant sirens weaving into the hum of life.

        I didn’t plan to be up there. It started with a walk, one of those aimless kinds where your feet figure out where you're going before your mind does. Somehow, I ended up staring at the skyline, wrapped in my jacket, hands shoved deep into my pockets, watching the world happen from a distance. There’s something strange about being above it all — close enough to feel part of it but just far enough to feel invisible.

        <title>Lotus in the Rain</title>
        <subtitle>The Calm</subtitle>

        I found this piece the other day and couldn’t stop staring at it. A lotus, blooming under the relentless fall of rain — delicate, fragile, but undeniably strong. The colors are wild. A muted storm of blue dots forms the flower and the sky, while two bold red panels interrupt everything — like symbols dropped in from a different world. One spiral pulls you in, the other swirls with clouds, a snake, and blossoms.

        I didn’t expect to get hit by something as simple as an image today, but here we are. Sometimes the right thing finds you exactly when it should.
